## Creating a Collection

To create a collection, simply run the following command:

```bash title="Shell"
punkt create-collection
```

You can make it private by simply adding the flag `--private`:

```bash title="Shell"
punkt create-collection --private
```

## Deleting a Collection

To delete a collection you own, you must first ascertain its `handle`. Once you have the handle, execute:

```bash title="Shell"
punkt delete-collection 77
```

## Adding Files to Your Collection

Before uploading files to the Hub, you must ensure they are synchronised to the Local State. Once synchronised, you may publish them using the collection handle:

```bash title="Shell"
punkt publish 77 ~/audrey.txt
```

<Callout>
    At present, only individual files are supported for upload; directories cannot be uploaded. The target path provided must be an Active State path. Furthermore, file names must be unique within the collection.
</Callout>

## Removing Files from Your Collection

To remove a file from a collection you own, simply run the command with the collection handle and the file name:

```bash title="Shell"
punkt unpublish 77 audrey.txt
```
