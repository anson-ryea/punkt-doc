## What is Punkt?

Punkt is a command-line tool designed to help you manage your dotfiles and configuration files across multiple machines.

In practice, Punkt operates similarly to Git, as it uses Git behind the scenes to track changes and synchronise dotfiles from various directories, storing them in a centralised repository.
