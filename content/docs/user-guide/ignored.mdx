title: Ignoring Files
description: Using .punktignore to prevent files from being synchronised to the Local State.

## .punktignore

Much like `.gitignore`, placing a `.punktignore` file in the root of the Local State directory enables you to specify files and directories that should be excluded from synchronisation to the Local State.

<Callout type="warn">
    Patterns may be specified in a manner similar to `.gitignore`, but they are not exactly identical. However, there are plans to make it `.gitignore` compliant before v1.0.0.
</Callout>

<Accordions type="single">
    <Accordion title="Which wildcards are supported and how are patterns parsed?">
        Internally, these `glob` patterns are processed via the [Java PathMatcher](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-).

Here is an example:
```text title=".punktignore" lineNumbers
# Ignore text files starting with in any subdirectory but not in the root
**/a*.txt

# Ignore "audrey" anywhere, both in the root and in any subdirectory
audrey
**/audrey

# Ignore all .tmp files in root
*.tmp
# Ignore the file or folder in root
bak
# Ignore backup files ending with a tilde in root
/*~

# Ignore .log files inside in root
logs/**/*.log
# Ignore .cache files inside any "cache" directory
**/cache/*.cache
```

## Default Ignored Patterns

By default, Punkt employs two lists of ignored patterns: one to filter Active State files during synchronisation to the Local State, and another to ignore files residing within the Local State itself (such as files commencing with a dot).
