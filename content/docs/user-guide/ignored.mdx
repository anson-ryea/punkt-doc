## .punktignore

Much like `.gitignore`, placing a `.punktignore` file in the root of the Local State directory enables you to specify files and directories that should be excluded from synchronisation to the Local State.

Patterns may be specified in a manner identical to `.gitignore`.

<Accordions type="single">
    <Accordion title="Which wildcards are supported?">
        Internally, these `glob` patterns are processed via the [Java PathMatcher](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-).
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Here is an example:
```text title=".punktignore" lineNumbers
# Ignore the directory "audrey" anywhere in the tree
**/audrey/
# Ignore text files starting with "a" anywhere
**/a*.txt
# Ignore the "Desktop" folder anywhere
**/Desktop/

# Ignore all .tmp files anywhere
*.tmp
# Ignore the file or folder anywhere
bak
# Ignore backup files ending with a tilde in the top-level Local State directory
/*~

# Ignore .log files inside any "logs" directory
logs/**/*.log
# Ignore .cache files inside any "cache" directory
**/cache/*.cache
```

<Callout>
    If no path separators (e.g. `/` or `\`) are included, the pattern will match all files and directories with that name within any directory.
</Callout>

## Default Ignored Patterns

By default, Punkt employs two lists of ignored patterns: one to filter Active State files during synchronisation to the Local State, and another to ignore files residing within the Local State itself (such as files commencing with a dot).
