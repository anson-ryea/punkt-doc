<Steps>
    <Step>
        ## Initialising Punkt
        
        To begin using Punkt, you must first initialise a Local State:
        
        <Accordions type="single">
          <Accordion title="A new Punkt Local State">
            ```bash title="Shell"
              punkt init
            ```
          </Accordion>
          <Accordion title="Existing remote Punkt repository">
            ```bash title="Shell"
              punkt init audrey/dotfiles
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </Accordions>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      ## Managing Files and Directories
      
      To bring your files and directories under Punkt's management, simply execute `punkt sync` followed by your desired paths as arguments.
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
        punkt sync ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.audrey
      ```
      <Callout>
        By default, Punkt recurses into directories. To prevent this behaviour, use the `--no-recurse` flag.
      </Callout>
      Should you modify any dotfiles in the Active State, simply run `punkt sync` again to update the Local State.
    
    </Step>
    <Step>
      ## Editing Your Dotfiles
      
      Over time, you will inevitably wish to make changes to your dotfiles. You may do so in one of two ways:
      
      <Accordions type="single">
          <Accordion title="Edit files in the Active State">
            Edit the Active State, then execute `punkt sync` to update the Local State.
          </Accordion>
          <Accordion title="Edit files in the Local State">
            Edit the Local State, then execute `punkt activate` to update the Active State.
          </Accordion>
      </Accordions>
      
      This presents a dilemma:
      > Should I edit the dotfile in the Active State or the Local State?
      
      **Short answer:** It does not matter.
            
      **Long answer:** In the long run (and provided you remember), we advise editing dotfiles in the Local State. This offers several advantages:
      - You may leave partially completed dotfiles in the Local State, and your applications will continue to use the unmodified versions in the Active State until you execute `punkt activate` when you are ready.
      - Although less intuitive, there is a higher likelihood that you will remember to commit and push your changes to the remote repository.
      - In the future, when scripts and templates are introduced, dotfiles may be generated from them; in such cases, only the Local State should be modified.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      ## Tracking Changes With Git
      
      To utilise version control, simply execute Git commands as you normally would. However, you may call `punkt git` from any location to apply Git commands specifically within the Local State repository.
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
        punkt git add .
        punkt git commit -m "Initial commit"
        punkt git push
      ```
      
      <Callout type="warn">
        `punkt git` only works if you have Git installed on your system.
      </Callout>
    </Step>
    
    <Step>
      ## Applying Changes to Your Dotfiles
      
      After editing dotfiles in your Local State, it is crucial to execute `punkt activate` to ensure the Local State versions are applied to the Active State.
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
        punkt activate ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.audrey
      ```
      
      If you wish to apply all dotfiles managed by Punkt, simply execute:
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
        punkt activate
      ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
