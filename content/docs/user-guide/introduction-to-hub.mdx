      ## Browse Available Collections
      
      Punkt Hub hosts a variety of dotfiles shared by the community. These are organised into collections, each containing a curated set of configuration files. You are free to browse and download these collections to customise your environment.
      
      To list all public collections, execute the following:
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
      punkt hub list
      ```
      
      To view only your own collections, use the `--mine` flag:
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
      punkt hub list --mine
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step> 
      ## Inspect a Collection
      
      After listing the available collections, you may discover entries such as:
      
      | Name | Description | Handle | Last Updated
      ---|---|---|---
      | Audrey's Collection | Audrey's favourites | 77 | 2025-01-01
      
      To explore the contents of a specific collection, simply run the list command with its unique `handle`:
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
      punkt hub list 77
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step> 
      ## Synchronise a Collection
      
      Should you find a collection that piques your interest, you may synchronise it to your Local State with the following command:
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
      punkt hub sync 77
      ```
      
      Please remember to run `punkt activate` afterwards to apply the dotfiles from the collection.
    </Step>
    <Step> 
      ## Unsynchronise a Collection
      
      If you no longer require a collection, you may easily remove it by running:
      
      ```bash title="Shell"
      punkt hub unsync 77
      ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
